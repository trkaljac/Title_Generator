    Create a properly structured mobile-friendly, mobile-first, responsive
    webpage here, with a form that asks the user for their "title," favorite
    drink, pet's name (current or past), and favorite fictional place.
    All text boxes must be plain type="text" boxes with NO client side
    error checking. A simple demo is provided for you to test and see
    how it works. This demo is not formatted properly or styled. You must
    format and style properly with proper instructions and a reasonably
    professional looking interface. See instructions for more guidance.

        This form uses the post and HTML submit buttons
        We will not normally do things this way, but it's
        an easy way to get started with submitting data
        to the server. When the submit button is pressed
        the information in the form is sent to the server
        and is processed by the server side code in process.php
